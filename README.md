# NNDL
Neural Network and Deep Learning course 

### Homework 1 - Supervised Deep Learning
  - 2 pt: implement basic regression and classification tasks
  - 2 pt: explore advanced optimizers and regularization methods
  - 1 pt: optimize hyperparameters using grid/random search and cross-validation
  - 2 pt: implement CNN for classification task
  - 1 pt: visualize weight histograms, activation profiles and receptive fields

### Homework 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning
  - 1 pt: implement and test (convolutional) autoencoder, reporting the trend of reconstruction loss and some examples of image reconstruction
  - 1 pt: explore advanced optimizers and regularization methods
  - 1 pt: optimize hyperparameters using grid/random search and cross-validation
  - 1 pt: implement and test denoising (convolutional) autoencoder
  - 1 pt: fine-tune the (convolutional) autoencoder using a supervised classification task
  - 1 pt: explore the latent space structure (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) and generate new samples from latent codes
  - 2 pt: implement variational (convolutional) autoencoder
  
### Homework 3 - Deep Reinforcement Learning
  - 2 pt: study how the exploration profile impacts the learning curve. Tune the model hyperparameters or tweak the reward function in order to speed-up learning convergence
  - 3 pt: learn to control the CartPole environment using directly the screen pixels, rather than the compact state representation 
  - 3 pt: train a deep RL agent on a different Gym environment
